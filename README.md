# ShopPal

## What it does:
ShopPal is an IOS app that allows users to take a picture of their receipts and save them in the app. Users can then view, sort and organize their receipts at any time.

## How we built it: 
We used Swift to design the user flow of the application and develop several pages of the IOS app. We also created functions in Swift to facilitate communication between the app and the server, including login, signup and fetching user-uploaded receipts. To ensure that the user's private information was securely stored, we integrated a stay logged-in feature using Swift Keychain.

## Challenges we ran into: 
One of the biggest challenges we faced was building the backend server using Node.js and Express. We had to ensure that all user actions were facilitated, including login, signup, uploading a receipt, retrieving multiple receipts, etc. We also faced challenges while integrating and utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS), including EC2, S3 and DynamoDB, to store data and images and host the server.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
We are proud of the user flow we designed, which makes it easy for users to navigate the app and access their receipts. We are also proud of the stay logged-in feature we integrated, which ensures that the user's private information is securely stored. Lastly, we are proud of the backend server we created, which facilitates all user actions, including login, signup, uploading a receipt, retrieving multiple receipts, etc.

## What's next: 
We are planning to add more features to the app, such as the ability to categorize receipts, set reminders for returns, and integrate with other apps such as budgeting apps. We also plan to make the app available for android as well.
